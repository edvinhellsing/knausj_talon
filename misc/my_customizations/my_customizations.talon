#A general advice if I may, try to find a quite idiomatic way for short commands because you risk to have difficulty to remember them when you would have 50 of them. Personally i use a y suffix for most of my short commands: lessy, listy, movy, taily, awky and so forth

#Question. in knausj_talon what is the difference between edit.find() and user.find()?
#If you find them in actions.list() they should both have descriptions

#Otherwise, you should check out events.tail() in the repl to see what's happening behind the scenes for specific commands
