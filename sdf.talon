# Something I did yesterday which is technically trivial but actually was really useful. I made a scratch.talon file, where I can define temporary commands related to the given task Iâ€™m working on.

# For example I kept running `rm -rf foo && npx create-next-app foo`. So I made a command `test setup foo`.

# It took 1 minute and probably saved me like 15-20 min or a lot of keyboard strokes.
